Movepub is an R package to prepare animal tracking data from [Movebank](https://movebank.org) for publication in a research repository. With movepub you can document data with metadata following the [Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/) standard and transform these to [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org) and Ecological Metadata Language ([EML](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/)) for publication to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ([GBIF](https://www.gbif.org)) and the Ocean Biodiversity Information System ([OBIS](https://obis.org)).

To get started, see:

- [Prepare your study](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-content/archiving-movebank#general_best_practice_tips): guidelines on how data owners should prepare their study in Movebank for archiving, prior to using this package.
- [Get started](https://inbo.github.io/movepub/articles/movepub.html): an introduction to the packageâ€™s main functionalities.
- [Function reference](https://inbo.github.io/movepub/reference/index.html): overview of all functions.

Note that Movebank users retain ownership of their data, and use should follow the [general Movebank terms of use](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-content/general-movebank-terms-of-use) and any other license terms set by the owner.

## Installation

You can install the development version of movepub from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("inbo/movepub")
```

## Usage

This package supports two use cases:

- [Make a Movebank dataset "frictionless"](https://inbo.github.io/movepub/articles/movepub.html#frictionless) with `add_resource()`. This is useful when publishing a dataset on e.g. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org).
- [Transform a Movebank dataset to Darwin Core](https://inbo.github.io/movepub/articles/movepub.html#dwc) with `write_dwc()`. This is necessary when publishing a dataset to [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org).
