Movepub is an R package to prepare [Movebank](https://movebank.org) animal tracking data for publication in a research repository or the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://gbif.org).

You can install the development version of movepub from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```

## Usage

This package supports two use cases:

- [Make a Movebank dataset "frictionless"](https://inbo.github.io/movepub/articles/movepub.html#frictionless) with `add_resource()`. This is useful when publishing a dataset on e.g. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org).
- [Transform a Movebank dataset to Darwin Core](https://inbo.github.io/movepub/articles/movepub.html#dwc) with `write_dwc()`. This is necessary when publishing a dataset to [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org).
