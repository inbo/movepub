# movepub

Movepub is an R package to prepare animal tracking data from
[Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/) for publication in a research
repository. With movepub you can document data with metadata following
the [Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/) standard and
transform these to [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org) and Ecological
Metadata Language ([EML](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/)) for
publication to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
([GBIF](https://www.gbif.org)) and the Ocean Biodiversity Information
System ([OBIS](https://obis.org)).

  guidelines on how data owners should prepare their study in Movebank
  for archiving, prior to using this package.

Note that Movebank users retain ownership of their data, and use should
follow the [general Movebank terms of
use](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-content/general-movebank-terms-of-use)

## Installation

You can install the development version of movepub from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("inbo/movepub")
```

## Usage

This package supports two use cases:

- [Make a Movebank dataset
  “frictionless”](https://inbo.github.io/movepub/articles/movepub.html#frictionless)
  with
  [`add_resource()`](https://inbo.github.io/movepub/reference/add_resource.md).
  This is useful when publishing a dataset on
  e.g. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org).
- [Transform a Movebank dataset to Darwin
  Core](https://inbo.github.io/movepub/articles/movepub.html#dwc) with
  [`write_dwc()`](https://inbo.github.io/movepub/reference/write_dwc.md).
  This is necessary when publishing a dataset to
  [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org).
