\description{
Transforms a published Movebank dataset (formatted as a
\href{https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/}{Frictionless Data Package})
to Darwin Core CSV and EML files that can be uploaded to a
\href{https://www.gbif.org/ipt}{GBIF IPT} for publication.
A \code{meta.xml} file is not created.
}
\section{Metadata}{


Metadata are derived from the original dataset by looking up its \code{doi} in
DataCite (\href{https://api.datacite.org/dois/10.5281/zenodo.5879096}{example})
and transforming these to EML.
Uses \code{datacite_to_eml()} under the hood.
The following properties are set:
\itemize{
\item \strong{title}: Original title + \verb{[subsampled representation]}.
\item \strong{description}: Automatically created first paragraph describing this is
a derived dataset, followed by the original dataset description.
\item \strong{license}: License of the original dataset.
\item \strong{creators}: Creators of the original dataset.
\item \strong{contact}: \code{contact} or first creator of the original dataset.
\item \strong{metadata provider}: \code{contact} or first creator of the original dataset.
\item \strong{keywords}: Keywords of the original dataset.
\item \strong{alternative identifier}: DOI of original dataset. This way, no new DOI
will be created when publishing to GBIF.
\item \strong{external link} (and alternative identifier): URL of the Movebank study.
}

To be set manually in the GBIF IPT: \strong{type}, \strong{subtype},
\strong{update frequency}, and \strong{publishing organization}.

Not set: geographic, taxonomic, temporal coverage, associated parties,
project data, sampling methods, and citations. Not applicable: collection
data.
}

\section{Data}{


\code{package} is expected to contain a \code{reference-data} and \code{gps} resource.
Their CSV data are loaded in to a SQLite database,
\href{https://github.com/inbo/movepub/blob/main/inst/sql/movebank_dwc_occurrence.sql}{transformed to Darwin Core using SQL}
and written to disk as CSV file(s).

Key features of the Darwin Core transformation:
\itemize{
\item Deployments (animal+tag associations) are parent events, with tag
attachment (a human observation) and GPS positions (machine observations) as
child events.
The parent event itself does not contain any information other than an ID.
\item The tag attachment event often contains metadata about the animal (sex,
lifestage, comments) and deployment as a whole.
\item No event/occurrence is created for the deployment end, since the end date
is often undefined, unreliable and/or does not represent an animal
occurrence.
\item Only \code{visible} (nonoutlier) GPS records that fall within a deployment are
included.
\item GPS positions are downsampled to the first GPS position per hour, to reduce
the size of high-frequency data.
It is possible for a deployment to contain no GPS positions, e.g. if the
tag malfunctioned right after deployment.
