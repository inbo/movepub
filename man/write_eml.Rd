\title{Transform Movebank metadata to EML}
\usage{
write_eml(doi, directory, contact = NULL, study_id = NULL, derived_para = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{doi}{DOI of the original dataset, used to get metadata.}

\item{directory}{Path to local directory to write file(s) to.}

\item{contact}{Person to be set as resource contact and metadata provider.
To be provided as a \code{\link[=person]{person()}}.}

\item{study_id}{Identifier of the Movebank study from which the dataset was
derived (e.g. \code{1605797471} for \href{https://www.movebank.org/cms/webapp?gwt_fragment=page=studies,path=study1605797471}{this study}).}

\item{derived_para}{If \code{TRUE}, a paragraph will be added to the abstract,
indicating that data have been transformed using \code{write_dwc()}.
Example:

Data have been standardized to Darwin Core using the \href{https://inbo.github.io/movepub/}{movepub} R package and are downsampled to the first
GPS position per hour. The original data are available in Dijkstra et al.
(2023, \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10053903}), a deposit of Movebank
study \href{https://www.movebank.org/cms/webapp?gwt_fragment=page=studies,path=study1605797471}{1605797471}.}
}
\value{
EML file written to disk.
And invisibly, EML object.
}
\description{
Transforms metadata of a published a Movebank dataset (with a DOI) to an
\href{https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/}{EML} file.
}
\details{
The resulting EML file can be uploaded to an \href{https://www.gbif.org/ipt}{IPT}
for publication to GBIF and/or OBIS.
A corresponding Darwin Core Archive can be created with \code{\link[=write_dwc]{write_dwc()}}.
See \href{https://inbo.github.io/movepub/articles/movepub.html#dwc}{Get started}
for examples.

\section{Metadata}{

Metadata are derived from the original dataset by looking up its \code{doi} in
DataCite (\href{https://api.datacite.org/dois/10.5281/zenodo.5879096}{example})
and transforming these to EML.
The following properties are set:
\itemize{
\item \strong{title}: Original dataset title.
\item \strong{description}: The original dataset description and an optional generated
paragraph (see \code{derived_para}).
\item \strong{license}: License of the original dataset.
\item \strong{creators}: Creators of the original dataset.
\item \strong{contact}: \code{contact} or first creator of the original dataset.
\item \strong{metadata provider}: \code{contact} or first creator of the original dataset.
\item \strong{keywords}: Keywords of the original dataset.
\item \strong{alternative identifier}: DOI of the original dataset.
This way, no new DOI will be created when publishing to GBIF.
\item \strong{external link} and \strong{alternative identifier}: URL created from
\code{study_id} or the first "derived from" related identifier in the original
dataset.
}

To be set manually in the GBIF IPT: \strong{type}, \strong{subtype},
\strong{update frequency}, and \strong{publishing organization}.

Not set: geographic, taxonomic, temporal coverage, associated parties,
project data, sampling methods, and citations.

Not applicable: collection data.
