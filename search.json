It contains animal tracking data collected for the study O_ASSEN using trackers developed by the University of Amsterdam Bird Tracking System (UvA-BiTS, http://www.uva-bits.nl). The study was operational from 2018 to 2019. In total 6 individuals of Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus) have been tagged as a breeding bird in the city of Assen (the Netherlands), mainly to study space use of oystercatchers breeding in urban areas. Data are uploaded from the UvA-BiTS database to Movebank and from there archived on Zenodo (see https://github.com/inbo/bird-tracking). No new data are expected. #>       See van der Kolk et al.
