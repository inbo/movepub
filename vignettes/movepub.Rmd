## Convert a Movebank dataset to Darwin Core

A Movebank dataset can be converted to Darwin Core using `write_dwc()`. Let's try it out with a small dataset.

**O_ASSEN** is a bird GPS tracking study and dataset, available on [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/cms/webapp?gwt_fragment=page=studies,path=study1605797471) and deposited on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5653311).

`write_dwc()` requires the dataset to be structured as a [Frictionless Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) (recognizable by the presence of a `datapackage.json` file). That is the case for O_ASSEN on Zenodo, meaning it can be read with the [frictionless](https://frictionlessdata.github.io/frictionless-r/) R package.

Let's create two directories:

```{r}
dir_source <- "o_assen/source" # Local directory for the source dataset
dir_dwc    <- "o_assen/dwc"    # Local directory for the Darin Core dataset
```

And download the dataset from Zenodo to the local directory. Using a local package avoids having to download the data every time it is being read. We then create a `package` variable pointing to the local dataset:

```{r}
frictionless::read_package("https://zenodo.org/record/5653311/files/datapackage.json") %>%
  # Not applicable here, but one can speed up downloading by removing large
  # resources that won't be used, e.g. remove_resource("acceleration")
  frictionless::write_package(dir_source)

package <- frictionless::read_package(file.path(dir_source, "datapackage.json"))
```

That covers the data. The metadata are derived from [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) using the dataset DOI. For O_ASSEN, the DOI is already stored in the package metadata:

```{r}
package$id
```

DataCite metadata does not include a contact person and rights holder, so we need to set those:

```{r}
contact <- person("Peter", "Desmet", , "peter.desmet@inbo.be", , c(ORCID = "0000-0002-8442-8025"))
rights_holder <- "Vogelwerkgroep Assen"
```

We now have everything to convert the dataset to Darwin Core and EML:

```{r}
movepub::write_dwc(
  package = package,
  doi = package$id,
  directory = dir_dwc,
  contact = contact,
  rights_holder = rights_holder
)
```

The resulting `eml.xml` file includes the metadata:

```{r}
EML::read_eml(file.path(dir_dwc, "eml.xml"))
```

The resulting `dwc_occurrence.csv` contains the Darwin Core data:

```{r}
readr::read_csv(file.path(dir_dwc, "dwc_occurrence.csv"))
```

Both files can be uploaded to a GBIF IPT for publication. The dataset will use the DOI of the source dataset.
